## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**Do I need to be a developer for this hackathon?**

No. Anyone can **create beautiful looking pages in SharePoint or use the SharePoint agents** to increase their productivity. Anyone can submit their work for the competition and everyone is awarded with a badge to do so.

**We have a product build for/with SharePoint - can we submit?**

Yes. Anyone can submit to this hackathon. If you are a partner who has created an intranet-in-a-box offering, you can also submit your design or agent scenarios for this hackathon. Any submission which contains SPFx customizations would fall on that specific category and we'll take the submission background also into account in the judging.

Notice that *we are looking into engaging with our intranet-in-a-box providers more closely after this event* to setup specific partner showcase blog posts and interviews. Submit a video on your solution and well definitely will be in touch after the hackathon to share your story as a separate partner showcase video and a blog post.

**Do I need to create something new or can I submit video of what we already have?**

You are NOT expected specifically to create any new designs or code during this hackathon, so if you already have a beautiful intranet or are using SharePoint Agents, those stories are also welcome.

We want everyone to be able to submit their beautiful UX designs, SharePoint Agents stories or SPFx experiences for the competition to showcase the art of possible within SharePoint.

**What will be expected from the submissions?**

There are two important things to do for each submissions:

1. Register to the hackathon - https://aka.ms/SharePoint/hackathon/register
1. Submit an issue with link to the video which demonstrates your submission - https://aka.ms/SharePoint/hackathon/submission

**We have a cool SharePoint design on our intranet, can I submit that?**

Yes as long as you have permission from your company or the service owner to do that. We are excited to see what kind of use cases you have with SharePoint Agents and what kind of designs our customers and partners have created with SharePoint and Viva Connections.

**How should I create the video for submission?**

There are multiple ways to do this. Key is to highlight the design and features you have in your deployment. You can use whatever software you like for recording and then submit the entry to us in a location which can be accessed. This could mean attaching video on the submission entry, video in YouTube (can be unlisted if link works) or by sharing a video with file sharing services, like with OneDrive.

**How many people can be in a team which is building a submission?**

One submission can be from 1-4 people. You can submit as an individual person, or you can join with other community members to build a team with maximum 4 persons in the team.
